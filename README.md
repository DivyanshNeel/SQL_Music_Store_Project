## Description
This project will teach how to analyze the music playlist database. This analysis of the database with SQL will help the store to understand its business growth by answering some questions.

## Project Background
This project focuses on the analysis of the dataset of an online music store by using SQL. In order to make better decisions about the store's growth, the project will answer a set of questions regarding its performance.

## Key Learning Skills
- Data Import and Management Using **Python**
I learned to import data using python into my database. I used visual code IDE where I leveraged the power of **pandas** library and **create_engine** funtion from the SQLAlchemy library to import the *.csv* files into the database.

- SQL Querying
This project sharpened my SQL querying skills significantlly. I wrote various types of queries to retrieve specific information from the database based on the questions provided. This included simple SELECT statements, joins, aggregation functions, subqueries, and more complex operations.

- Problem-Solving and Critical Thinking
Finally, working through a list of questions provided for the project, it required problem-solving and critical thinking skills. I was encountered with scenarios where I had to interpret the questions, identify the relevant data, and formulate SQL queries to extract the required information effectively.
